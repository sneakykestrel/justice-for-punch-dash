# Justice For Punch Dash mod for I Am Your Beast

In the IAYB demo, hitting a punch on one enemy while aiming at a different enemy would teleport you to that second enemy. This has since been patched because the developers hate fun. 

This mod restores that bug!

NOTE: while playing with this mod, times will not be saved by default. Theres an option to turn saving back on but i cant see why youd really want to do that. ill be very angry if you turn it back on trust me

# Installation

!!! You need [Bepinex 6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, put the dll into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
